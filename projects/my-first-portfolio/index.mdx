My first portfolio designed and developed after 4 months of classes.
The design was made on Figma and thought Mobile first.

<br />
This very first personal site will have allowed me to put into practice all the fundamentals
seen in first year of Bachelor Web.

<br />
It allowed me to get my first internship and work-study contract.
