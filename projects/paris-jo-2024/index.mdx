This website is a group school project, it was created to help foreign tourists to optimize their stay in Paris for the 2024 Olympics.

<br />
The concept of the prototype is simple, the user just has to select the sporting
disciplines he wishes to attend. Once the selection is made, an algorithm calculates
the best located districts for an optimal stay in Paris according to several criteria
(nature, culture, hotels and restaurants). On click on the appropriate district,
a dashboard presents its classification and the corresponding data.
