My first freelance project done on a voluntary basis with 1 year of experience.
This small showcase site was very enriching for me because I had total freedom for the design of the models and I was able to set up a small Design System.

<br />
Originally developed under WordPress environment, I used ACF for dynamization content.

<br />
It is unfortunately no longer online but I plan to recreate it using Gatsby and Strapi.
